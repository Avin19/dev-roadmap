Definition of **Set** ![set definition](./access/images/figure_1.png)

There is some Sets of Number ![sets of numbers](./access/images/figure_2.png)
 
If we visualize R as a line. Segments of this line are called **intervals** of numbers. **Interval notation* associated with given sets of number ![interval notations](./access/images/figure_3.png)

We will often have to combine sets. There are two basic way to combine set: **intersection** and **union** ![combine set definition](./access/images/figure_4.png)


### <span style="color:orange;">The cartesian Coordinate Plane</span>
In order to visualize the pure excitement that is Precalculus, we need to unite Algebra and Geometry. Simply put, we must find a way to draw algebraic things
Let's start with possibly the greatest mathematical achievement of all time: the **Cartesian Coordinate Plane**
![cartesian coordinate plane](./access/images/figure_5.png)
The horizontal number line is usually called the **x-axis** while the vertical number line is usually called the **y-axis**.
We then describe the point P using the **ordered pair** (2; âˆ’4). The first number in the ordered pair is called the **abscissa** or **x-coordinate** and the second is called the **ordinate** or **y-coordinate**.

The axes divide the plane into four regions called **quadrants**. They are labeled with Roman
numerals and proceed counterclockwise around the plane:

One of the most important concepts in all of Mathematics is **symmetry**. There are many types of
symmetry in Mathematics, but three of them can be discussed easily using Cartesian Coordinates.
